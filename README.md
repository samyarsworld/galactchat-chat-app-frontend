## About

This is a real-time chat application made using React and Redux as frontend, and Node.js, MongoDB Atlas as backend. Socket.io library is used for real-time data exchange. The project includes an authentication page with registry that in addition to normal register and login info, it has a section to create AI-made pictures for your profile picture using Open AI DallE. Also, files are stored in Cloudinary cloud storage. The chat includes all chat functionality like real-time typing, notifications, messages, image message, emojis, last seen, seen, or delivered notification, and media storage for each chat.

# Chat App

Welcome to our Chat App, an easy-to-use platform for real-time messaging with your friends and contacts. Our app offers the following features:

### User Registration and Profile Management

To get started, simply register an account and create your profile. You can select an image from your local computer or use our AI-driven image generator. Just describe what you're imagining and the AI will create an image for you.

### Real-Time Messaging

Once you're logged in, you'll see a list of all the people you've previously connected with on the left-hand side of the screen. Simply click on a user to start a conversation with them. The chat interface is located in the middle of the screen, and you can send text messages, upload pictures, or add fun emojis to your messages.

### Media Sharing

On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the profile information for the friend you're chatting with, as well as a media-sharing section that includes all the media files you've sent or received from that specific user.

### Responsive Design

The app is fully responsive, meaning you can use it on any device. The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile screens, so you'll always have a great user experience no matter how you access the app.

## Developer Features

- **Scalable State Management with Redux and Redux Thunk:** State management is done efficiently and effectively by using Redux and Redux Thunk libraries. This provides a better architecture and a single source of truth for state. React hooks such as `useRef`, `useEffect`, and `useState` are used to update the state.

- **Secure User Authentication and Authorization:** Users can securely register and log in with their credentials. The authentication middleware and cookies check for previous logins with the help of the `jsonwebtoken` library. The registration process is secured using the `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `validator` libraries.

- **Server Information Displayed Using Toasts:** Users are provided with server information using toasts and toaster components to make the user experience better.

- **AI-Generated Profile Pictures Using OpenAI DallE:** An AI-powered image generator using OpenAI DallE is used to create profile pictures for users who do not want to upload their own picture.

- **Real-Time Chat Functionality with Typing Indicators and Notifications:** Chat functionality is implemented in real-time, complete with typing indicators, notifications, and last seen, seen, or delivered notifications using sockets and the `socket.io` library. React `useEffect` hook is also used for efficient state updates.

- **Sound Notifications and Emoji Support:** Users are notified of new messages with sound notifications, and emojis are supported for more expressive communication.

- **Saving Media with Cloudinary Cloud Storage:** Media files are saved using Cloudinary cloud storage for efficient file storage.

- **Safe Data Storage Using MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose:** Meta data, messages, and users are stored safely in MongoDB Atlas using the Mongoose library.

- **Secure Data Transfer Using Axios and Redux Actions:** Data is securely transferred from the frontend to the backend using the Axios library through Redux actions.

- **UI Icons and Components From Various Libraries:** The app's UI is made more attractive using various icons and components from libraries such as `react-icons`, `react-spinners`, and `moment`.
